# OSX Development Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------
My super simple repo and script to setup my development environment

`make` - download and installs my environment
`make clean` - uninstalls my environment, but does not remove downloaded files
`make nuke` - uninstalls my environment and removes all downloaded files
