# Development Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------
My super simple repo and script to setup my Mac development environment.

My enviroment is installed by running the following command in your terminal from within your home directory `cd ~`

Install Cmd:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreyhulen/enviroment/master/install.sh)"
```

Uninstall Cmd:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreyhulen/enviroment/master/uninstall.sh)"
```

To make local modifications look at `~/.enviroment`
