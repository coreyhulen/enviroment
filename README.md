# Development Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------
My super simple repo and script to setup my development environment.  It should work for both OSX and linux.

`make` - download and installs my environment

`make clean` - uninstalls my environment, but does not remove downloaded files

`make nuke` - uninstalls my environment and removes all downloaded files
