# Development Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------
My super simple repo and script to setup my development environment.  It should work for both OSX and linux.

`make` - download and installs my environment

`make clean` - uninstalls my environment, but does not remove downloaded files

`make nuke` - uninstalls my environment and removes all downloaded files

Other helpful hints:
- I like to remap the `Caps Lock` key to `Control` by going to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Modifier Keys`
- I like to remap the menu `Command` keys to `Control` by going to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Shortcuts` > `App Shortcuts` and adding shortcuts like `Copy` = `^C`, `Paste` = `^V`
